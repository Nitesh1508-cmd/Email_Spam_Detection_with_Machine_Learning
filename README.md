# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is an **Email Spam Detection System** that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Machine Learning algorithms. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction, followed by a machine learning model for classification.

The implementation is done in a **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**, making it easy to understand and experiment with the code.
